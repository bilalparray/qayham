    <p>We collect only the minimum data required for the app to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> Google account sign-in is used via Firebase Authentication. We
            receive basic profile information such as your email address and unique user ID.</li>
        <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Notes created by you are stored securely to enable synchronization across
            your devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate users using Google Login</li>
        <li>To sync notes across multiple devices</li>
        <li>To maintain app functionality and reliability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        Notes and authentication data are stored securely using Firebase services.
        We do not access, read, or analyze the content of your notes.
    </p>
    <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, but no method
        of electronic storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties.
        Data is only processed through Google Firebase services for authentication and storage.
    </p>

        Cloud Notes uses the following third-party service:

        Their use of information is governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is retained only as long as your account is active.
        If you delete your account, your notes and associated data are permanently removed.
